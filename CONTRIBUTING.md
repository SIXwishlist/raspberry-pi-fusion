# How to contribute?
How to contribute code whether you've got a bugfix, documentation update, or new feature for the Pi Fusion project, these are the steps to follow to contribute code back into the main Pi Fusion repo. Use the following possibilities to contribute to the project.

## Opening an issue:
You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

- Report an error you can’t solve yourself.
- Discuss a topic or idea.
- Propose a new feature or other project idea.

Tips for communicating on issues:

- If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
- If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
- If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.
